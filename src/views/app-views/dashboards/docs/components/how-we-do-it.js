          <strong>Cross Chain Farming </strong>
        is the first fully audited, deflationary cross-chain Farming as a Service (FaaS)
DAO on Binance Smart Chain. Our aim is to optimize the power of farming across all chains, offering
simple and low fee access to DeFi 3.0 for everyone.
				</p>
        <p>
          We farm for you whilst using reflections and buy-backs to benefit holders, creating sustainable long
          term price action.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we are the first FaaS DAO to offer additional services including decentralized token
          launch, listings as well as on-chain and off-chain security audits. Funds from all these services will
          also be used for buy-backs, farming, and marketing to support the native CCF token.
