          In simple terms,
          <strong> DeFi yield farming </strong>
          is a strategy of utilizing your crypto assets to generate more crypto.
				</p>
        <p>
          It involves locking or lending your assets via smart contracts. For example, by staking your tokens to help with the
          governance of a decentralized ecosystem, or providing liquidity to trading pairs on decentralized exchanges. In return
          you receive yields, usually in the form of fees. Sounds simple right?
        </p>
        <p>
          However, today yield farming has become multifaceted. It requires complex strategies, moving funds around to
          secure the best returns and has become dominated by whale investors. In addition, transaction fees and the risk of
          scams make it prohibitive for many to get involved and benefit from these returns.
